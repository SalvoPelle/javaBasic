     *    Which would work best? Why?
     *
     * Q Example: Print out the numbers 1 to 10
     * A Example: fori
     *
     * Q1: A user inputs their actions into an ATM, they can withdraw, deposit, check balance or exit. What loop should we use?
     * A1: do while. before we run the cycle, after we make a choice of what we want to select.
     *
     * Q2: We have a list of 1000 users to send emails to
     * A2: for each. we need to send emails to all so we don't need the index.
     *
     * Q3: We want to print out the first 80 customer names from our bank database
     * A3: fori. we don't know how many customer has our database so we can set an index<80 and we can print just the fist 80.
     *
     * Q4: We want to read a file 100 lines at a time, without loading the full file into our program
     * A4: while. we don't know how many lines we have. for is not the right choice.
     * ancora non ho veramente capito bene perchè e quando usare while e do while al posto del ciclo for. ho ancora un po' di confusione.
